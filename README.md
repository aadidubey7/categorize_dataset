# categorize_dataset

- Download the covid-19 Surveillance dataset csv from the below URL.
  https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/covid19-case-surveillance-public-use-dataset

- Stored the dataset file in the **dataset** folder.
- Rename the filename to **COVID-19.csv**.
- Verify your path mentioned in the **index.py** file.
  "dataset/COVID-19.csv" (Mentioned the same in the index.py)
  
 - I have added a func called "**validate_csv()**" just to check whether the csv file exists.
